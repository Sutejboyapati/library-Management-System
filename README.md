# Library Management System

## Project Description

The Library Management System follows a modular architecture and makes full use of relational database features such as transactional operations and enforced foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity. It supports secure user authentication with role-based access control (RBAC), complete book lifecycle management, review systems, and administrator controls. The backend is designed to safely handle concurrent borrowing and returning operations by multiple users.
