Library Management System

Project Description
Library Management System will follow a modular architecture and will make full use of relational database features such as transactional operations and enforced foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity. It will support secure user authentication with role-based access control (RBAC), complete book lifecycle management, review systems, and administrator controls. The backend will be designed to safely handle concurrent borrowing and returning operations by multiple users.
